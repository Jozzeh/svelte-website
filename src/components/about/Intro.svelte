              I am a problem-solver that spend several years working in
              webdevelopment agencies making websites and e-commerce shops. A
              few years ago, I shifted to big web-applications and I love it.
              There is nothing greater than going from an idea to a good
              product... And I feel lucky to be a part in that process.

              In my spare time, I'm a father of 3 lovely daughters but also try
              to contribute to open source projects as much as possible. When I
              see some new tech, my hands are itching to try and see what I can
              create with it.
